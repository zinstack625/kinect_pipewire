# Pipewire driver for Microsoft Kinect (v1)

This is a userspace driver for microphone assembly of Microsoft Kinect for Xbox 360. It generally needs firmware at runtime, but I, with very high chances cannot tell you where, how, and whether you can get it. Kinect SDK for Windows should have one.

## Build Instructions

### Dependencies
- libfreenect
- pipewire >= 0.3
- meson
- pthread

### Building
    git clone https://github.com/zinstack625/kinect_pipewire
    cd kinect_pipewire
    meson setup build
    cd build
    meson compile
    
    # for installation
    meson install
    # and load module in pipewire. The only way I know as of now is to include it in pipewire config (look for docs)

# Licence
A mashup of code from libfreenect and pipewire makes a mashup of Apache v2 and MIT licenses. If you're a lawyer and know better, tell me
